"""AlphaEvolve initial program for the Erdos Minimum Overlap problem.

We represent each step function as a sequence of numbers, as follows:
Starting from an arbitrary sequence of numbers, we first augment it to
simultaneously satisfy three requirements:
  (a) a zeroed prefix (first 12.5% of elements),
  (b) a strict range of [0, 1], and
  (c) a mirrored sum equal to exactly half the length of the resulting symmetric
    sequence.
Then we create a mirrored sequence, which is the perfectly symmetrical version
of this sequence. This mirrored sequence defines the heights of the step
function, which has all intervals of equal length.
