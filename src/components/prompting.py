# Prior programs
Previously we found that the following programs performed well on the task at hand:

{previous_programs}

# Current program
Here is the current program we are trying to improve (you will need to propose
a modification to it below):

{code}

# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The opening fence: ```python
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of up to 4 lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
7. The closing fence: ```

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content,
character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will replace *all* matching occurrences.
Include enough lines to make the SEARCH blocks uniquely match the lines to
change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each
change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for
uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from
its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Make sure that the changes you propose are consistent with each other. For
example, if you refer to a new config variable somewhere, you should also
propose a change to add that variable.

Example:
```python
{diff_search}
    return total_loss
{diff_mid}
    # Add sparsity-promoting regularization to the loss.
    total_loss += self.hypers.l1_reg_weight * l1_reg

    return total_loss
{diff_replace}
```
and
```python
{diff_search}
  return hyper.zipit([
{diff_mid}
  return hyper.zipit([
      hyper.uniform('l1_reg_weight', hyper.interval(0.0, 0.01)),
{diff_replace}
```

ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
